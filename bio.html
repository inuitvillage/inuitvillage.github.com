<h1>Quittner-Strom, Ezekiel B.</h1>
<h2 id="history">A Brief History</h2>

<p>Born on a clouded mid-summer's day into the home and hands <br />
of old-world artisans, it seemed the babe knew from the first<br />
that stoicism would be his only. He didn't cry as air warm summer air<br />
filled his lungs. He came into the world blinking slowly over wide eyes.<br />
His Blacksmith Mother and Baker father gave him the name Ezekiel, secretly <br />
hoping that their actions had bound fate, and that this Ezekiel would raise <br />
new life from skeletons and spectres of their family lives. And so he was an <br />
only child, who didn't learn the true meaning of irony until much later in life.<br />
And alas, to his parents dismay, their son shed the name "Ezekiel", instead <br />
adopting the moniker "Zeke". And though he was literate, and perhaps even intelligent<br/>
he found pleasure only in physical labor. A part of himself he still stuggles with<br />
at university, to this very day.
