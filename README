The pages I have created bath both the HTML5 validator and the css validator.
Technically, everything has been implemented to the requested specifications.
However, with a very limited working knowledge of both HTML and css (I was 
earnestly exposed to using them last week) these pages are somewhat of a hack-
job. 
That said, I put in a bit of work into figuring out the horizontal navigation
bar, and would like to learn more css and better css implementation style.

This project took me approximately 15 hours, even though it doesn't show.
My collaborative partner was mainly the internet.
